Shattered my iPhone 6 screen and contacted Jacob on Sunday, by Monday my phone was fixed! Super easy making an appointment and no more than 5-10 minutes later my phone was fixed! Thank you!!",

I gave them the address to my work place and they were able to come to me to fix my phone. I love how convenient they were and it only took 10 min to have my screen fixed. To fix my iPhone 6 was $110 which is not bad given how great their service was. Highly recommend them.",
