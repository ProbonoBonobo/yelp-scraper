It is Saturday morning and you drop your new phone and completely shatter your phone! :(When I first started to search for a repair provider, I came to discover that they were not available, have run out of the supplies, or simply don't respond. \u00a0On the contrary to that, Jacob with Mobile iPhone iPad screen repair was our light at the end of the tunnel. We need our phone repaired today, and he is able to accommodate and fit us in! Once we meet up, with Jacob, he's amazing! He is friendly, professional, and fast! He did an amazing job repairing our phone!! So if you find yourself in a pinch like us, Jacob is the guy to contact!! \u00a0Thank you, Jacob!! Hopefully I don't need my iPhone 7 or 7s repair in the future! \u00a0:)",

I'm watching the sunset at Cardiff beach, when I have the bright idea to get a time lapse of said sunset on my iPhone 6 Plus. cool right? until you prop it up without any support, & get a text, vibrates, & falls, boom. cracked screen. this happened at 7:20pm. so what do I do? hop on Yelp to see who can fix my phone. everyone is either closing soon, or already closed. come across Jacob & his company, it says 24\/7. \u00a024\/7 huh? so I call this guy, & ask him when can get get me in for this broke phone of mine. he says, 3pm tomorrow. I tell him, cmon bro, I can't be out here looking reckless. can you fit me in tonight? now I'm in del mar, & he says if you can meet me in santee at 8, I got you. ok. bet. head down to santee at this little Starbucks. side note. there was a guy in there on his laptop play WOW, & talking to his bros. thought that was funny. anyways, here's my man Jake sitting, looking like Morpheus from the matrix. lol. tools and parts, ready to go. this guy is a wizard. screws stick to the screw driver via magnets, & he's doing this screen replacement like a one man nascar pit crew. 730 screen is cracked. 830 phone looks like new. not to mention, he threw on a screen protector for free as well. oh, and my friend, her screen is cracked too, she opted not to get it fixed tonight. Jake really cares, & put on a screen protector on her phone as well, for free, to prevent further damage. now if that's not good service, idk what is. I don't plan on breaking my phone anytime soon, again, but I will deff be sending any one and everyone I know who needs repair, his way.",

And none of the others were able to beat the price quoted by JacobThe fact that they offer a mobile repair service was an added bonus considering our unpredictable schedules. Set up an appointment for next day at my workplace. Jacob and Devin showed up a bit earlier in fact They were extremely professional , knowledgable ,got down to work without wasting a second. And replaced the broken screen in a jiffy. Also offered a tempered glass protector for a discount. The phone looked neat and new but I noticed some lines showing up when the screen was black. I just called them again to check if anything was wrong. They absolutely didn't mind coming back and checked once again. I really appreciate the honesty of these guys for I'm sure 9\/10 times I would have gotten a response that it was an existing fault with the phone if I had gone else where to fix the screen. Jacob did admit it was a problem with the screen(albeit the first instance for a 6 plus screen )and instantly replaced with another one without any issuesOn the whole it was a smooth process and would definitely seek out these guys if anything untoward happens to our phones \u00a0in the future",
