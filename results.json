It is Saturday morning and you drop your new phone and completely shatter your phone! :(When I first started to search for a repair provider, I came to discover that they were not available, have run out of the supplies, or simply don't respond. \u00a0On the contrary to that, Jacob with Mobile iPhone iPad screen repair was our light at the end of the tunnel. We need our phone repaired today, and he is able to accommodate and fit us in! Once we meet up, with Jacob, he's amazing! He is friendly, professional, and fast! He did an amazing job repairing our phone!! So if you find yourself in a pinch like us, Jacob is the guy to contact!! \u00a0Thank you, Jacob!! Hopefully I don't need my iPhone 7 or 7s repair in the future! \u00a0:)",

I'm watching the sunset at Cardiff beach, when I have the bright idea to get a time lapse of said sunset on my iPhone 6 Plus. cool right? until you prop it up without any support, & get a text, vibrates, & falls, boom. cracked screen. this happened at 7:20pm. so what do I do? hop on Yelp to see who can fix my phone. everyone is either closing soon, or already closed. come across Jacob & his company, it says 24\/7. \u00a024\/7 huh? so I call this guy, & ask him when can get get me in for this broke phone of mine. he says, 3pm tomorrow. I tell him, cmon bro, I can't be out here looking reckless. can you fit me in tonight? now I'm in del mar, & he says if you can meet me in santee at 8, I got you. ok. bet. head down to santee at this little Starbucks. side note. there was a guy in there on his laptop play WOW, & talking to his bros. thought that was funny. anyways, here's my man Jake sitting, looking like Morpheus from the matrix. lol. tools and parts, ready to go. this guy is a wizard. screws stick to the screw driver via magnets, & he's doing this screen replacement like a one man nascar pit crew. 730 screen is cracked. 830 phone looks like new. not to mention, he threw on a screen protector for free as well. oh, and my friend, her screen is cracked too, she opted not to get it fixed tonight. Jake really cares, & put on a screen protector on her phone as well, for free, to prevent further damage. now if that's not good service, idk what is. I don't plan on breaking my phone anytime soon, again, but I will deff be sending any one and everyone I know who needs repair, his way.",

        "content": "All I can say is the customer service is WAY ABOVE AND BEYOND. \u00a0First off I emailed a few places on Yelp for quotes and I got a phone call as soon as I hit send which really impressed me. \u00a0I was at work and couldn't meet until later in the day which was no problem for him. \u00a0He arrived 10 minutes earlier than the time we agreed upon so I appreciated the fact that he was prompt. \u00a0My phone had a new screen on it within 10 minutes and he was done. \u00a0He was very professional and friendly and I felt comfortable having him in my house as a single woman. \u00a0So here is where I think it gets even better. \u00a0I noticed my phone was acting off after the screen was replaced so I text him and asked if this was normal and he said it should be exactly like it was prior to it breaking. \u00a0I thought ok, it's probably just me so I would wait a day. \u00a0Well later than evening I wanted to break it again because I was so frustrated so I sent a Yelp message at some crazy hour and what do you know? First thing in the morning he calls me and texts me and said he would come back out and fix it that it may be a faulty screen. \u00a0He came to my office exactly when I asked him too and fixed my phone which is now perfect. \u00a0I guess every now and then you can get a faulty screen or something doesn't get connected back just right. \u00a0Now some people may think well it should have been right but here is the thing. \u00a0Do you know how to replace a screen in a matter of minutes? \u00a0I sure don't and I don't know anything about the process but I think it's crazy that it can be replaced so I was beyond ecstatic with how much he cared and fixed my problem right away. \u00a0It's \u00a0so hard to find good customer service, I can tell he owns and runs his business to please his customers. \u00a0I highly recommend this service to anyone who needs a screen replaced ASAP.",
